The apartments are architecturally pleasing with wide hallways, great views, and lots of light. The community is very well designed. The neighbors are nice. There is a nice pool, hot tub, BBQ, clubhouse, also well designed. My friends were always impressed when I brought them over. There is a nice bridge over a creek and wooded area which leads to a walkable shopping area with places to eat and coffee shops. Good school district. Great location. The property management team is professional and responsive. Jen and Tasha are especially standout property managers with a friendly professional attitude and excellent customer service. The management team was responsive and prompt when it came to maintenance. The only suggestions I have for improvement is the process for paying the last month's rent is needlessly confusing and a bit of a hassle. There were also two cars stolen in the year I was there, but these seem like isolated incidents, and the neighborhood itself and the surrounding is very safe, family oriented and upscale. I felt very safe there. Still, I think the apartment complex could be more vigilant about who they let come on the property. I see lots of friends of friends of friends using the pool and other facilities, and could consider beefing up security. Overall though, excellent experience. I would say Altitude is probably the best apartment complex in Kansas City."",""sourceURLs"":[""https://www.apartments.com/altitude-970-kansas-city-mo/g65egbw/#yhzxwsv-2-unit""],""title"":""A good place to live""},{""date"":""2023-07-10T00:00:00.000Z"",""dateSeen"":""2025-07-23T01:26:55.654Z"",""rating"":5.0,""text"":""Altitude 970 has been such an amazing home.

They charge you as far as they can!3)You will lose your mailing package if you live in Spectrum Apartments. There are a lot of mixed packages in three buildings. To find your mailing package, you must search all buildings. We lost one of our packages and the managers were never responsive.4)The managers and staff are not responsive and impolite. I experienced bad and impolite reactions from managers and staff several times. 5)Some nights, their workers forgot to take trash on time. The hallway was dirty most of the time.6)There always is a bad smelling in the hallway. 7)They show you a model unit that is totally different from the unit you are going to move in. They showed us a unit with new cabinets and kitchen stuff. However, when we moved in, we realized that all stuff is very old and different from what we saw in the model.8)When they are convincing you to rent their apartments, they are nice.

Below are a couple of topical reviews:Leasing/Office Staff:The two that work in the office have been some of the best and friendliest that I have ever dealt with in all of the apartments I've lived. First, I was in a hurry to sign a new lease when moving across the country and they rushed to get all of the paperwork and an apartment ready in two days. They are very courteous to notify everyone when there are issue (e.g. water to be turned off, etc.). They will also put in large packages into the apartment units if asked, which I think is beyond what many would do.Units:The units are really nice, especially now that most (all?) of them have hardwood floors (tile in the bath) and renovated kitchens with brand new appliances and counters/cabinets. (I'll plug my one real complaint here. The renovation of the kitchen left me kitchen-less for a few weeks, which was quite annoying.) I have an efficiency that is much larger than what I expected, so space (at least for me) is not an issue. The only minor issue I had with the unit was that the noise of others in the hall or people that close their unit doors too hard could leak into my unit. This actually has seemed to be diminished quite a bit when they installed carpet in the hallways - could be real or that I don't pay any attention. These noises are not too bad at all. I love my apartment overall.Common areas:Besides the mail room (which I think needs no review except that the lobby was renovated and looks newer/nicer), I have used only the laundry room and gym. The laundry room is pretty standard. Recently it has had some slight updates and new machines that don't solely require quarters, so that is nice. There is lots of machines (5-6 of each washers and dryers). There is also lots of room where some people hang their clothes to dry. The gym in the building is nice with a couple of treadmills, a bike, an elliptical and some free weights. It seems to be all newer equipment. There are also a couple of TVs for those that want to catch some shows while working out.Location:This apartment is sitting on Connecticut Ave. just below Chevy Chase Circle. There is a Safeway just two blocks up the road, which another couple of smaller stores (grocery, seafood, alcohol) within that range. There are also restaurants and other shops easily within a few minute walk (e.g. Starbucks, men's barber shop, dry cleaners). Walking a little south will put you in front of the Politics and Prose bookstore and another set of places to eat. There is a L2 bus line that stops right by the apartment that can take you into downtown DC or to the red line Van Ness metro stop. I think there is a bus line that goes to Friendship Heights as well. I walk to the FH station in about 10 minutes, so it's pretty close.Overall, this apartment is really nice. I would recommend it to whoever is looking for one in the area."",""sourceURLs"":[""https://www.apartments.com/la-reine-apartments-washington-dc/hz0t182/""]},{""date"":""2015-09-28T00:00:00.000Z"",""dateSeen"":""2024-12-16T15:30:15.021Z"",""rating"":4.0,""text"":""I have lived at the La Reine for a little over one year and love it here! When looking for a home in the area (Chevy Chase DC), I found that the rents here were a little higher than other area buildings, but felt it was worth it for what I wanted. The building is from the 1920s and retains that charm inside and out. Great architecture, high ceilings, wood floors, glass door handles, French doors to the kitchen, etc. In addition to the charm, the building was redone not long ago, complete with new kitchens (solid surface counters, glass front cabinets, stainless appliances). The kitchens are very sweet and use space well. There is a small gym onsite (just a small fee to get the fob and then no charge) and the neighborhood is great for running if you prefer the outdoors. It's also close to a small commercial strip that is convenient: groceries, pharmacy, library, small historic movie theater, and a few restaurants. It is relatively quiet for DC, but I like that. Management was helpful during move-in and has been extremely responsive to maintenance requests (although there have been few). I have had NO pest issues, but keep my unit very clean. My unit is bright, breezy with the bay windows open, and sunny. The windows are newer and help with the street noise when closed. I haven't had significant issues with noise from other units, but may just have quiet neighbors. Generally, tenants seem to be the responsible and respectful type---I feel very safe and have had no issues. My only complaints come with an older building---heating system is old, cooling is through window units. The bathrooms are mostly original and could use updating (although clean, freshly painted when I moved in). With regard to location, Friendship Heights Metro is walkable (~.7 miles), but the roads to get there are dark/deserted at night, so I typically only walk to Metro during the day. There is a garage for a fee. I always find street parking, usually within a block or so, but sometimes I am 2 blocks away depending upon time of day.

Inside, the home offers great bones, classic charm, and opportunity to customize to your liking. The layout is functional, the potential is real, and the neighborhood has long-time residents who take pride in their homes. Already attracting serious attention, this property has gone under contract twice. In both cases, circumstances unrelated to the home prevented closing—one buyer withdrew post-contingency and forfeited earnest money, and the second did not meet their hard money lender’s approval. No inspections report was shared (no repairs requested) and no appraisal was ordered in either case. If you’re looking for a opportunity to build home equity in a great area with community roots and convenient access to downtown Cleveland, this one deserves a visit.
